Hello, let me introduce myself. I am Kevin Adiputra Mahesa, a dedicated student at the University of Sriwijaya. I am thrilled to present my first project, a website inspired by the fantastic tutorial on the "Web Programming UNPAS" YouTube channel. The tutorial, titled "Creating a RESPONSIVE Coffee Shop WEBSITE with HTML & CSS from 0 + Autodeploy to WEB HOSTING," served as the foundation for this exciting endeavor. You can watch the tutorial here: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVkMmYL-aY).

I'm passionate about web development and learning new skills in the ever-evolving world of technology. This project is a testament to my commitment to honing my skills and producing quality work.
